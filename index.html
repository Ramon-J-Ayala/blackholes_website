<h2> What is a Black Hole?</h2>

<p>A black hole is an area in space where gravity is so strong
that nothing, not even particles or light can escape it. Because
of this, black holes can't be seen and can only be seen with a
attachment for space telescopes. With this attachment scientists
see how stars start to act different around black holes.</p>

<h2> How Big are Black Holes?</h2>
<p>Black holes are able to range from being very big to very small.
Some scientists even think the smallest black hole is the size an
atom. Even though they may be small, black holes that small still
can have the mass equal to a mountain. Another kind of black
holes are called stellars. These are able to have the masses up
to 20 times the amount of the sun. The Largest ones are
"Supermassive" and can have masses more than 1 million times
the sun. </p>
